<h2 style="color: #44AEFB, font-size: 24px">About</h2>

Welcome! My name is Giovanni Marques and I'm a Back-end Developer. I'm currently studying Computer Science.

During my professional journey, I was introduced to Back-end development, which aroused my curiosity and thirst for knowledge. The complexity and challenges of this area have motivated me to continue seeking to improve my skills and knowledge.

I'm currently concentrating on courses to acquire new skills and also on developing personal projects using the following technologies:

<ul>
  <li>JavaScript;</li>
  <li>TypeScript;</li>
  <li>Node.js;</li>
  <li>Express;</li>
  <li>NestJS;</li>
  <li>PostgreSQL;</li>
  <li>Prisma;</li>
  <li>Git;</li>
  <li>GitHub;</li>
</ul>

In addition, I have a keen interest in software architecture and practices such as SOLID, DDD, MVC, Clean Architecture and Hexagonal Architecture, applying them to my projects to ensure a solid and maintainable structure.
